- documentation
  - add doc-comments
    - fields passed to inflectors

- parking lot
  - default values for optional fields??
    - does this make sense when mapping to arbitrary types?
    - ideally, cost would be paid at field read time, not deserialize time
  - writing to/reading from a stream
  - eventmachine implications, if any
